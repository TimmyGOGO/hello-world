# hello-world
trial repository

This is my first project on github.com. I have started it in order to realise the concept 
and technology of the source. 

A little bit about myself. I'm in my early twenties and trying to find the goal of the whole 
life. The idea that would be worth keeping save and fighting for. I put the purpouse in front of myself
and fight tooth and nail to get it done correctly. I'm trying to sort out the ideas in my head
so that I can understand what have done, what is waiting to be done and what i'm doing now. 
Sometimes It occured to me that I have a passion of perfectionism, it really happended. This seldom
seems unrealistic and dull, but I know why I'm using this. It serves for other people, that idea warm me up.
